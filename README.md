## About the Project:

  ðŸ‘‰ A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs. It may also cover additional duties and tasks connected to the project. A portfolio is used to establish centralized management and oversight for numerous projects and programs.

## Description:
  
  ðŸ‘‰What this project hopes to achieve. A person, company that makes investments, or financial institution that owns a portfolio is a collection of financial assets. That. Is the prevailing notion
  . Selecting the ideal mix of assets to reduce investment risk and increase return is essential for successful portfolio management. A portfolio is a collection of different assets a person owns to help them reach their financial goals. They can also use personal portfolio websites to learn more about their skills.

## Project Timeline:
                    
  ðŸ‘‰Since the personal portfolio website consists of 3 filesâ€”HTML defines the structure of your content, CSS establishes the style and layout, and JavaScript makes the content interactiveâ€”it makes the most sense to learn the three languages in that order. The project life cycle is planned and completed in one week in order to build several stages in a portfolio app.

## Project Resources:

   âœ”	There are many front-end web development tools available for different specific requirements, including tools for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, code editing tools, deployment tools, prototyping and wire-framing tools, security tools, and many more. These front-end applications were used to create the portfolio website.
                    
   âœ”	Backend server is used.

  ## Establishing a linkage between the login page and the database:


   âœ… To authenticate a user's access, a login form makes use of their credentials. Typically, it consists of a username, email address, and password. However, other fields could be added to increase the site's security.
   
   
   âœ… A Windows web development environment is WampServer. It enables the development of web applications using a MySQL database.Â Additionally, phpMyAdmin makes it simple for you to administer your databases.
  
   
   âœ… Use the mysqli_connect() function in PHP to establish a database connection. Server name, username, password, and database name are the four arguments required. PHP's require_once('db_credentials') function.

## Visual Studio Code:
                    
ðŸ‘‰The streamlined code editor Visual Studio Code supports task execution, version control, and debugging. Improve the adaptability and output of developers. Streamline each stage of development with the help of resources and tools to help programmers create the upcoming wave of apps. Utilizing GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
   <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Github Functionalities:
 
ðŸ‘‰Users are able to create repositories for storing and sharing  source code through the cloud-based service Github. By integrating Github with Visual Studio Code, you can collaborate with others inside your editor and share your source code. The website for the portfolio was made using applications.
